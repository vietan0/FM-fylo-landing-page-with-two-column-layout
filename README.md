## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup

-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- [The problem of nested \<img\> inside \<a\>](https://developpaper.com/question/the-problem-of-a-nested-img-tag/)

```css
/* fix weird height problem */
a {
	display: inline-block;
	line-height: 0px;
}
```

- Flex-grow equals 1 makes item fill container
```css
flex-item {
	flex-grow: 1;
}
```

- [Specify width & height attributes to prevent layout shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-d_SoCHeWE)
```html
<img src="icon.svg" alt="" width="100" height="100"> 
```
